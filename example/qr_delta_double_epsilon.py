"""
We use QR decomposition to find linearly independent natural tensors that are obtained
from higher dimensional space.

TODO, here we focus on multiple delta and a double contraction with a single epsilon:
e_aij d_kl d_mn T_ijklmnpq

We first perform contraction to and and symmetrize the remaining indices: apq,
then embed the tensor back to its original space X_ijklmnpq.

If we do not consider symmetrizing and removing trace, this is:
e_ai'j' e_aij d_kl d_k'l' d_mn dm'n' T_ijklmnpq

The e_ai'j' e_aij operation embeds the tensor back to its original space, i.e. exchanging
the index `a` with two new indices `i'` and `j'`.

In other words, after contraction, we add new indices (indicated by ') to the original
space.

in einsum notation, this is:
d # delta
e # epsilon

out = einsum('ai'j', aij, kl, k'l', mn, m'n', i'j'k'l'm'n'pq -> ijklmnpq', e, e, d, d, T)

But we need to consider the symmetrization and traceless condition. With that in mind,
we do it in the below way:
1. Contract with deltas and epsilons:
    S_apq = e_aij d_kl d_mn T_ijklmnpq,
    which can be done as:
        rule1 = "aij, kl, mn, ijklmnpq -> apq"
        einsum(rule1, e, d, d, T)
    In the meanwhile, we need to construct the for step 3 below:
        rule2 = "aij, kl, mn, apq -> ijklmnpq"
        einsum(rule2, e, d, d, S)
    As seen, the rules hare highly related, the ones associated with epsilon and delta
    are the same, and only need to switch the positions of the two associated with
    T_ijklmnpq and S_apq.
2. Symmetrize and remove the trace of in S_apq
3. Embed the tensor back to its original space
   X_i'j'k'l'm'n'pq = e_ai'j' d_k'l' dm'n' S_apq,
   which can be done use rule 2 above.


For backward embedding, we do not perform epsilon contraction, and the rule is:
1. Contract with deltas and epsilons:
    S_apq = e_aij d_kl d_mn dm'n' T_ijklmnpq,
    which can be done as:
        rule1 = "aij, kl, mn, ijklmnpq -> apq"
        einsum(rule1, e, d, d, T)
    In the meanwhile, we need to construct the for step 3 below:
        rule2 = "kl, mn, apq -> aklmnpq"
        einsum(rule2, d, d, S)
    As seen, the rules hare highly related, the ones associated with epsilon and delta
    are the same, and only need to switch the positions of the two associated with
    T_ijklmnpq and S_apq.
2. Symmetrize and remove the trace of in S_apq
3. Embed the tensor back to its original space
   X_ak'l'm'n'pq = d_k'l' dm'n' S_apq,
   which can be done use rule 2 above.

# TODO, In qr_delta_double_epsilon.py, the above three steps are performed.
#  In that case, S_apq will be different for each choice of the delta and epsilon
#  indices. It turns this is not the correct way to check linear independence.
#  The correct way should be: using the same S_apq for all choices of delta and epsilon.
#  So, here the procedure is:
#  1. Create a symmetric traceless tensor S_apq
#  2. Embed the tensor back to its original space X_ijklmnpq, using rule2 above. (This
#     is step 3 above.)
