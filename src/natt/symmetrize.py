    Get the unique permutations of the indices to fully symmetrize a tensor.

    This works for the case where part or all of the indices are symmetric.

    Args:
        symmetry: A string that describes the symmetry already in the tensor. For
            example, `abba` means the first and the fourth indices are symmetric, and
            the second and the third indices are symmetric. The symmetry only applies to
            the indices after the `start_dim`.
        start_dim: the starting dimension to perform the operation. Dimensions before
            `start_dim` will not be used in the operation.

    Example:
        >>> get_permutations('abba')
        [[0, 1, 2, 3],  # abba
         [0, 1, 3, 2],  # abab

    """
    Get the unique permutations of the indices to fully symmetrize a tensor.
    that is obtained by tensor product with delta tensors.

    For example, `symmetry = xxyyaabb`, and `delta_indices = ab` means:
        1. indices 1 and 2 are symmetric (both associated with `x`), and indices 3 and
           4 are symmetric (both associated with `y`)
        2. indices 5 and 6 are symmetric (both associated with `a`), and indices 7 and
           8 are symmetric (both associated with `b`)
        3. indices 5,6 and 7,8 are symmetric because both `a` and `b` are in
           `delta_indices`, meaning they are associated with delta tensors.

    So, we consider three types of symmetries:
        1. symmetries in other indices of the tensor
        2. minor symmetry in delta tensors
        3. major symmetry in delta tensors

    For 2 and 3, consider, for example:
        delta_ij delta_kl = delta_ji delta_lk = delta_kl delta_ij,
    So, we have both minor and major symmetries in delta tensors.

    The above example can be though as symmetrizing a tensor Z obtained as:
        Z = X \otimes Y \otimes \delta \otimes \delta
    where `X` and `Y` are rank-2 symmetric tensors, and `\delta` are delta tensors.

    As another example, consider `symmetry = xxxxaabb` and `delta_indices = ab`, then
    it can be thought as symmetrizing a tensor Z obtained as:
        Z = X \otimes \delta \otimes \delta \otimes \delta
    where `X` is a rank-4 symmetric tensor, and `\delta` are delta tensors.

    As can be seen, `delta_indices` does not necessarily need to be associated with
    deltas. It can be indices of the same symmetric tensor. For example, the permutation
    of
        Z = X \otimes X \otimes Y \otimes Y
    where `X` and `Y` are rank-2 symmetric tensors,
    can be obtained using `symmetry = xxaabb` and `delta_indices = ab`.


    Args:
        symmetry: A string that describes the symmetry already in the tensor. This
            should be used together with `delta_indices`. See below.
        delta_indices: The indices that are associated with the delta tensors, for which
            need to consider both minor and major symmetries.
        start_dim: the starting dimension to perform the operation. Dimensions before
            `start_dim` will not be used in the operation.

    Returns:
        Each inner tuple contains the permutation indices for symmetrization.

    b. Major symmetry: the symmetry of indices between the deltas. For example,
