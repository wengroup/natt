    """Get the tensor product of Kronecker delta and Levi-Civita tensors.

    Note, the order of the indices need to be taken care of.
    Upper-case letters are used to represent tensors in the n space (namely for
    tensors T and such), while lower-case letters are used to represent tensors in the
    j space (namely for tensors X). So:
    1. X = H T: H would consist of both lower case and upper-case letters, and its
       upper-case letters are to be contracted with T. We assume the contracting rule
       is something like X_ab = H_abABC T_ABC.
    2. T' = G X: G would consist of both lower case and upper-case letters, and its
       lower-case letters are to be contracted with X. We assume the contracting rule is
       something like T'_ABC = G_ABCab X_ab.
    3. T' = G H T = S T: S would consist of only upper-case letters. We assume the
       contracting rule is something like T'_ABC = S_ABCDEF T_DEF, where the first
       half of the indices are associated with the embedded tensor T', while the
       latter half of the indices are associated with the original tensor T.
