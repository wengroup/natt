    """
    Convertor to map between ordinary cartesian tensor T and natural tensors X.

    The conversion is done as follows:
    X = H T
    T'= G T

    Args:
        rank: The rank of the tensor T.
        symmetry: symmetry of the Cartesian ordinary tensor, if any. For example,
            - "ij=ji" means that the tensor is a fully symmetric rank-2 tensor (e.g.
                stress tensor);
            - "ijk=ikj" means that the tensor is a rank-3 tensor with the last two
                indices symmetric (e.g. piezoelectric tensor);
            - "ijk=ikj=jik" means that the tensor is a fully symmetric rank-3 tensor;
            - "ijkl=jikl=klij" means that the tensor is a rank-4 tensor with both minor
                symmetry (between i and j, and between k and l) and major symmetry (
                between ij and kl). For example, the elastic tensor has this symmetry.
            The number of unique letters gives the rank of the tensor (what letters to
            use does not matter).
